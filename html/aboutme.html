      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>I created this page to highlight my coding skills, and my journey through the tech industry. While softwre development is relatively new to me I am picking it up very quickly. I am very eager to learn coding and web design and look forward to connecting with others who will help me grow in this field</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box-02">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p> After 4 years of working in the medical field, I made the decision to go back to school in 2016 to pursue my IT career. I have been fortunate to have been offered opportunities such as interning with the local YMCA in the IT Department, and landing my first IT technician role with Indiana Univeristy. Both were wonderful networking and growth opportunities. I have worked over 6 years in IT support, and have the opportunity to support a medical office, call center, and currently role with Amazon.</p>

      <h2>The Road To Becoming A Developer</h3>
        <p>I have always had an interest in coding. This has lead to me to continuing my education, and participating in a software development cohort. I want to broaden my skill set in order to strengthen my current technical background. I have learned basic/advanced html and css styling through lecture and course materials. I have broadened my own knowledge by incorporating my research and learning different ways to style pages with different kinds of css styling, flexbox, and use of icons which I find both fun and interesting. By doing this I hope to be able to pursue a career in coding or web design with a company that encourages personal growth, and promotes a team building environment.</p>

    <div class="box-05">
      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p> While I enjoy what I do, my first love has always been web design and code. I am currently pursuing a certficate in Software Development and hope that it will open new pathways for me to take my career to the next level. <br><br> When I am not being everyones friendly neighborhood IT Support Engineer you can find me spending time with my two cats and my boyfriend. I also enjoy working on my latest crochet or knitting project, playing my guitar or ukelele, hiking and researching fauna and flora, or trying to perfect my own recipies (the latest is a lemon tiramisu). I love all things cozy and the <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/what-is-hygge-4798043hyyge">hygge</a> lifestyle. Out of all the things I do in my downtime, nothing beats curling up with a good book. </p>
